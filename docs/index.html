<h1>A. Executive Summary</h1>
<div class="justify">
<p>This work is part of a five-year research project to develop, deploy and evaluate a communication training package for non-Indigenous mental health clinicians. The project aims to improve mental health communication between clinicians and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients. It is acknowledged that First Nations Australians have poorer health outcomes compared with the non-Indigenous population. Quality mental health communication between non-Indigenous clinicians and First Nations patients goes some way to overcoming barriers to health disparity.</p>
<p>Yarning circles were conducted across four hospitals and health services in Queensland, involving more than 130 non-Indigenous clinicians and Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander health workers. They shared their experiences in communicating with First Nations patients and strategies to support effective communication. Findings indicate that clinicians need to hold core values of respecting First Nations patients and acquire crucial skills such as building rapport, understanding local customs, and using layperson terminology. Furthermore, clinicians need to understand the patient’s history of oppression, experience of transgenerational trauma, and racism to fully implement a person-centered approach to quality mental healthcare.</p>
<p>During the next part of the co-design of the training, we will be speaking with patients to support them to describe their experience of accessing public mental health services and identify communication preferences when engaging with clinicians. A recurring theme identified by clinicians in our conversations, has been the need for the health system to provide clinicians with flexibility to realise quality mental health communication and health care for First Nations patients.</p>

<h1>B. Introduction and Background</h1>
<div class="justify">
<p>In Australia, almost 1 in 3 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adults (31% or 149,400) had high to very high levels of psychological distress in 2018–19, more than twice the levels of non-Indigenous adults (13%) <span class="citation" data-cites="aihw2020">(<a href="#ref-aihw2020" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2020</a>)</span>. In Queensland, mental health is a leading contributor to the burden of disease, accounting for approximately 20% of the total disease burden experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples <span class="citation" data-cites="qldhealth2016">(<a href="#ref-qldhealth2016" role="doc-biblioref">Queensland Health 2016</a>)</span>. The National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Leadership in Mental Health (NATSILMH) highlighted a need for culturally appropriate and accountable mental health services <span class="citation" data-cites="dudgeon2016">(<a href="#ref-dudgeon2016" role="doc-biblioref">Dudgeon et al. 2016</a>)</span>. A crucial next step in service development is to ensure that mental health services are culturally sensitive and safe; providing access to staff who practice respectful, reciprocal and person/family/community centric communication. This project comprise a cross-disciplinary team led by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander researchers and mental health clinicians. Engagement and co-design with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander consumers and communities, services providers, and policy makers are fundamental to the development, delivery and evaluation of a patient-centered and culturally sensitive communication training package for non-Indigenous mental health professionals.</p>
<p>This project aims to co-design, deliver, and evaluate a patient-centred and culturally sensitive communication training package for non-Indigenous mental health professionals to: 1) improve health outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients accessing Queensland health mental health services; and 2) build a culturally competent, responsive, and clinically safe mental health workforce. This report outlines the results of the yarning circles, during which mental health professionals share their thoughts, ideas, and experiences regarding their interactions with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients or clients.</p>
<p>In alignment with the principals and practice of co-design, this report will be circulated to the participants involved in the yarning circles; availing an opportunity to feedback, and ensure the accuracy and reliability of our interpretation of key messages arising from the yarning circles with clinicians. We will utilise a similar co-design process of reporting, checking and reviewing the key messages arising from our yarning circles with patients.</p>

<h1>D. Results</h1>
<div class="justify">
<p><strong>Mental Health Professionals (Clinicians) Level.</strong> Initial findings arising from yarning circles with clinicians seem to suggest that core values and specific clinical skillsets may be key to effective mental health communication. Core values, such as genuine care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients and a willingness to learn, can help support rapport building and subsequently reflect a commitment to person centered care. This genuineness includes acknowledging limitations of the service, and helping patients and clinicians be on the “same page” with respect to expectations and goal setting and from both a treatment/support and service perspective. Additionally, clinicians should see all patients as equally valid and valued compared with themselves. This perspective can help build a relationship with the patient; in contrast, clinicians reflected the importance of avoiding seeing the patient as an object that needs to follow instruction. Lastly, clinicians noted the need to have humility and acknowledge their own personal and professional biases; to be open to others’ perspectives, including those of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander colleagues, patients, cultures, customs, and belief systems.</p>
<p>Clinicians involved in yarning circles reflected that rapport-building is essential to establishing a trusting relationship with a patient. Additionally, it was recommended that clinicians need to avoid using jargon and instead use layperson terminology. Similarly, that engaging with the patient in a real conversation serves to empower them as an active participant in treatment planning; listening attentively to the person’s needs; offering options, such as tea or coffee, and allowing them to choose where to sit (e.g.&nbsp;at a table or on a comfortable couch).</p>

</figure>
</div>
<div class="justify">
<p><strong>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Patients Level.</strong> In addition to core clinical values and skills, participants in yarning circles noted that clinicians should be aware of their patients’ cultural and historical contexts. The cultural context may include the significant role of family and kinship for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients. Furthermore, clinicians should be familiar with the local culture where they are based (i.e.&nbsp;the community and region where they live and work). For example, offering food can be a good strategy to build rapport, but certain food sources can be considered sacred to certain people for a particular country (i.e.&nbsp;locality). Lastly, clinicians noted the importance of recognising the role and influence of diversity and difference in terms of their own communication style and sense of humor and that of the people whom they are supporting; and that they might differ slightly or significantly and thus influence communication.</p>
<p>It was noted that, understanding the historical context of the person (i.e.&nbsp;patient), may assist clinicians in delivering people-centered health care. The clinician needs to understand the full context of their patients’ experiences, which may include transgenerational trauma due to the history of colonisation, experiences of racism, and being part of the Stolen Generation. The patient’s ongoing experience of racism and mistreatment by society and authority figures, such as the police, can shed light on why the patient resists mental health services.</p>

<figcaption>Figure - Patient Level</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<div class="justify">
<p><strong>Mental Health System Level.</strong> This part of the conversation with clinicians discussed broader range factors impacting effective health communication. It was noted that the demographic aspect plays a role, as patients in rural or regional areas often have stronger bonds with their communities and may have different experiences with services. For example, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in rural areas have a higher chance of being transferred to a larger hospital in the city to receive more comprehensive treatment. Additionally, a patient’s age and gender were noted by participants as a factor that can influence the patients communication style and preferences; with younger patients tending to be more open to communicating with non-Indigenous clinicians. Lastly, it is important for clinicians to understand that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and peoples are not a homogenous group and that they individually and collectively have unique customs and traditions.</p>
<p>At an even broader systems level, mental health communication was noted to be dependent on the persons situation in terms of their progression through the health system. For example, while clinicians may try to take the time to build connections with their patients, they are often required to complete forms and mental status examinations within a timeframe to meet performance indicators. It is also essential for clinicians to be open to understanding the local health model in addition to the Western health model. Participants noted that the flexibility and openness of the local health setting, system, and model, support the clinician to adopt a person-centered approach when treating Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients. Lastly, the type of services available, such as long-term facilities, acute care, and emergency departments, influence, confound and determine the balance in terms of the importance and priority placed on building rapport, versus creating therapeutic relationships, versus managing crises.</p>

<div class="justify">
<p><strong>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mental health workers.</strong> Conversations with clinicians highlighted the important role of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mental health workers in facilitating effective communication between clinician and patient. However, they are often underappreciated, and many health services do not consider these workers to be a part of the treating team such that they are included in assessment or treatment planning. The roles of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mental health workers are often misunderstood, with some clinicians seeing their peers as interpreters or staff who can be called upon when there is an escalation. This reflection by clinicians in yarning circles, emphasises the need for clinicians to understand and engage in professional collaboration with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mental health workers to deliver person-centered, wholistic and evidence based mental health care.</p>

<p><strong>The Communication Training Package.</strong> All the findings described previously will be used to inform the development of the training. In addition, yarning circles have provided us with other valuable insights. For instance, the training content should include techniques for de-escalating tension. The initial stages of a clinical interaction are crucial for building rapport; therefore, the training should also cover strategies for how clinicians introduce themselves and sensitively ask for the patient’s personal information. Clinicians should also learn how to establish common ground with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients and use self-disclosure carefully during sessions.</p>
<p>Most research participants indicated a preference for face-to-face, full-day training conducted off-site from their workplace so they can engage fully with the training. However, it is important to consider that full-day training might also create complications with scheduling and covering staff from a clinical capacity and capability perspective. Training content should also include practical skills, allowing participants to learn interactively through case scenarios and role modelling. For example, the trainer could demonstrate a case example, and participants would analyse the effectiveness of the communication. On the other hand, role-playing seems to be the least preferred method; with clinicians involved in yarning circles citing anxiety about practicing in front of colleagues and with respect to performance generally. Lastly, the communication training needs to promote behavioural and mindset changes; specifically, the training should not serve as a basis for supporting ongoing professional development and not merely a template or checklist for communicating with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients.</p>

<h1>E. Moving Forward</h1>
<div class="justify">
<p>In this report, we have outlined findings arising from the yarning circles with non-Indigenous mental health professionals and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mental health workers. It has been highlighted through these conversations, that clinicians should hold a core value in respecting the First Nations patient, first and foremost. In addition to genuine care of the patient, clinicians should also acquire skills, such as, rapport building, using layperson terminology, and professionally work alongside Indigenous mental health workers. Further, clinicians should also be aware of the historical and cultural context of First Nations patients and that supports and empowers person-centered health care. Findings arising from the yarning circles acknowledge that systemic changes in healthcare as a system is required to make the effective mental health communication a priority.</p>
<p>The next step of the development of the communication training for this project, will be yarning circles with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients. In alignment with the co-design process, it is important that the communication training be developed with the person-centered goal and emphasis. The patient’s input and experiences will further enhance findings and the sensitivity of the training to deliver a quality and effective experience for participants (i.e.&nbsp;clinicians who receive the training) and from the perspective of supporting quality health care for the patient. Eventually, it is envisioned that clinicians will receive this patient-centred communication training through Phase 2 of the study. Further, we are committed to advocating for systemic-level changes that support our public mental health services to realise the vision and promise of quality services for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients, people, peoples and communities.</p>
